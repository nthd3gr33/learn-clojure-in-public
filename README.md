# Learn Clojure in Public
> "The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you."
~ B. B. King

## Why?
Learning Clojure in Public to hold myself accountable and to promote the [#LearnInPublic](https://twitter.com/_LearnInPublic_) initiative. 

## Specs

- For any days I do not make progress or I do not tweet, I will donate $25 to [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/). Will donate a minimum of $50 on August 1st, 2020 no matter what.
- Main goal is >= 1 commit to [Athens source code](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens)
- Member of [4th Cohort (Team Seneca)](https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam/blob/master/doc/clojurefam-rosters.md#4th-cohort-roster-group-study) in ClojureFam
