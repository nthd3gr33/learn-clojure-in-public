# Learn Clojure in Public
> "The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you."
~ B. B. King

## Why?
Learning Clojure in Public to hold myself accountable and to promote the [#LearnInPublic](https://twitter.com/_LearnInPublic_) initiative. 

## Specs
- 5 weeks (35 days) starting on June 25th, 2020
- For any days I do not make progress or I do not tweet, I will donate $25 to [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/). Will donate a minimum of $50 on August 1st, 2020 no matter what.
- Main goal is >= 1 commit to [Athens source code](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens)
- Member of [4th Cohort (Team Seneca)](https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam/blob/master/doc/clojurefam-rosters.md#4th-cohort-roster-group-study) in ClojureFam

## Only Goal that Matters
- [ ] At least 1 commit to [Athens source code](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens)

## Other Goals
- [ ] Finish 46 more [4Clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/user/nthd3gr33) problems (totaling 100)
- [ ] Daily [Twitch streams](https://www.twitch.tv/nthd3gr33) of learning Clojure
- [ ] Daily [tweets](https://twitter.com/nthd3gr33) about interesting things I learned or built
- [ ] Finish 8 chapters of [Clojure from the Ground Up](https://aphyr.com/tags/Clojure-from-the-ground-up)
